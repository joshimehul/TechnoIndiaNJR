                        This study focuses on the problems associated with the management of solid waste in the Savina
                        Vegetable Market, which is the largest market in the proposed Smart City Udaipur. An effective
                        system to treat solid waste in an environmentally friendly approach is required to be designed.
                        The main object of this study was to educate people about Solid Waste Management and the
                        benefits of separation at source and to estimate the number of separated wastes for the design
                        of the processing center for the Savina Vegetable Market. In this project total of 27 students
                        of Civil Engineering, 12 street cleaners, and 1 coordinator participated in educating and
                        executing solid waste management in the Savina Vegetable market.

                        The traffic congestion in the walled city progressively becomes the major component which would
                        influence the travel or working experience. Revitalization of Walled City will not only promote
                        heritage conservation but also give a strong boost to tourism and consequent economic upliftment
                        of the local population. In the research process, the behavior questionnaire and traffic flow
                        survey as the first quantitative measurements were used for 2 preparation days and 6 working
                        days. The behavior survey was attempted to identify the possible attitude or perspectives of the
                        people in Walled City, Udaipur. The results show that there are more than 50% of the
                        participants express the view of disagree or ambiguous perspectives about the transportation
                        condition nowadays. Moreover, there is nearly 70 percent of the whole local residents it is
                        difficult for them to finding parking in the Walled City. The traffic flow survey tries to
                        generally calculate the potential transport condition at a different time interval on certain
                        days. In the process, the different collection destination was settled and it ensured the
                        accuracy and usefulness of the statistics to some extent.

                        The students of third year M.E.( Batch 2018-2022) have designed and Fabricated an multipurpose
                        agriculture Vehicle in the most economical ways possible. The vehicle is powered by an 110 cc
                        hero honda pleasure engine. The vehicle is so designed that it can be used as an grass cutter
                        and can also be used as an small roller for making the lawn even. It can so be used for
                        transporting small loads. The design of the vehicle is kept simple, so that it can be used with
                        different attachments and machines with ease.

                        A team with students of III Year Mechanical Engineering(Batch 2016-20) took an ambitious and a
                        challenging project to build a formula hybrid car.The team built a parallel hybrid system, which
                        is powered by a petrol engine and an electric motor. The car is powered by a 390cc KTM-Duke-390
                        engine and a 48V motor powered by a 21.6Ah Lithium Ion battery. The hybrid system is designed in
                        such a way that the driver can choose the mode of propulsion. This system also charges the
                        primary batteries when the car is driven by the petrol engine. The car uses a CVT transmission
                        for the convenience of driving.
